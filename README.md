# Docker Machine Driver for Proxmox VE (Deepshore edition)

This driver can be used to kickstart a VM in Proxmox VE to be used with Docker/Docker Machine.

* [Download](https://github.com/lnxbil/docker-machine-driver-proxmox-ve/releases) and copy it into your `PATH` (don't forget to `chmod +x`) or build your own driver
* Check if it works with this super long commandline:

        [[ $(docker-machine create --driver proxmoxve --help | grep -c "proxmoxve-proxmox-host") == 1 ]] && echo "Proxmox Driver is installed" || echo "Proxmox Driver not found"

## Driver Options

explore them with `docker-machine create --driver proxmoxve --help`

### Clone VM

To use this driver you need to have a VM template with cloud-init support.

But do not worry, we have everything in place to get you running: go to the [ansible Folder](./ansible/Readme.md) and check the Readme.md
